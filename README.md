# Decentralized Music Composition and Concert Platform

## Overview

This Stacks blockchain smart contract implements a decentralized platform for music creators, composers, and concert organizers. The platform enables:
- Composition creation and management
- Concert organization
- Ticket sales
- Royalty management

## Core Features

### 1. Composition Management
- Create musical compositions with multiple creators
- Define royalty splits between creators
- Track composition status

#### Create Composition
```clarity
(create-composition 
  title: string 
  creators: (list 10 principal) 
  royalty-split: (list 10 uint)
)
```

### 2. Concert Management
- Organize concerts with a program of compositions
- Set ticket prices
- Schedule concert dates
- Optional guest performers

#### Create Concert
```clarity
(create-concert 
  title: string 
  program: (list 10 uint) 
  ticket-price: uint 
  date: uint
)
```

### 3. Ticketing System
- Purchase tickets for upcoming concerts
- Tickets are non-transferable and tied to the buyer
- Automatic payment collection

#### Buy Ticket
```clarity
(buy-ticket concert-id: uint)
```

## Key Constraints

- Creator and royalty list must match in length
- Royalty splits must total 100%
- Concert dates must be in the future
- Ticket purchases only allowed before concert date

## Technical Details

- Implemented on Stacks blockchain
- Uses Clarity smart contract language
- Manages state through maps and data variables
- Enforces access controls and validation rules

## Getting Started

1. Deploy the smart contract to Stacks blockchain
2. Composers can create compositions
3. Concert organizers can create concert events
4. Audience can purchase tickets

## Security Considerations

- Access controls prevent unauthorized modifications
- Explicit validation on all state changes
- Transparent tracking of compositions and concerts

## Future Improvements

- Implement royalty distribution mechanism
- Add guest performer selection
- Develop frontend interface
- Integrate with music streaming platforms
